All joking aside, we are looking for the right candidate to join our small, passionate team by helping develop and service our existing advertising clients. The perfect candidate would be an extraordinarily skilled person in php, HTML, CSS, Node.js, TypeScript, MySQL, Wordpress & customizing WP plugins, Google Cloud Platform, and CloudFlare.

We are driven, love what we do, and deliver results to every single client. We work naked (seriously, this is a remote gig so wear whatever you want), enjoy a relaxed work environment with flexible hours. This is a full-time, remote position. In your response, feel free to include anything that will ensure that you stand out among the other applicants (like maybe you used to moonlight as a photographer at GQ and Will Ferrell stumbled into a photoshoot drunk after falling asleep in the tanning bed).
