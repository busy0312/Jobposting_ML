We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly.

We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them.

We are looking for people that are quick learners, and are very efficient, to handle the demand. We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us.

We have the best mortgage protection program in the business, and we have serious demand nationwide; especially in the 703/202/301 area. After all, we are in a market where 95% of all Americans, if they added up all the insurances that they hold, would not have enough to cover their mortgage. Can you imagine a product that everybody NEEDS (not just wants), and all you have to do is meet with people that have already requested our service. No Cold Calling or Door Knocking! We are looking for someone that is very professional and is able to learn quickly, because you can't make six figures in a year by moving slowly. We will train you in every aspect of the business, and will show you how to personally produce a monthly commission of at least 7,000-10,000. We have the tools, and we are looking to bring on someone that we can groom into management. You will learn this business, and eventually we plan to teach you how to build a strong staff, that you will train to move product the same way that you do. This combination should easily push you into a yearly compensation of 150k+ within your first 3 years in the business if you move at a steady pace. Industry experience is not necessary, but a track record of success is. Our company mails out over 1.5 million letters each week and our homeowners fill out a questionnaire and mail back the request for coverage to us. We simply call that exclusive lead and set up an appointment with them. We meet the customer in their home and go over what type of mortgage protection the homeowner needs and then write up the policy. We also market and promote fixed indexed annuities that solve most of the baby boomers retirement issues. We have many full time agents making over 6 and 7 figure incomes! We are primarily looking for those that desire to move into management, though, if you are looking for part time or full time warm sales, please send your resume as well. We have a serious demand all over the 703/202/301 area that consistently outweighs our number of agents. Typically our employees make 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management. Though, we design a specific plan to make sure you hit whatever compensation YOU seriously desire, and are willing to work for. What we are looking for: * A passion to honestly help families. * Positive attitude with a strong desire to become wealthy. * A person who can follow a step by step selling system. What we are not looking for: *Someone who isn't accountable to their word. *Someone who says they are a great salesman, but doesn't have a penny to their name. *Someone who has had a recent foreclosure or bankruptcy (you can't get licensed in those cases) We need you and you need us. Contact us with your resume (preferred), or call the Hiring Manager  with your information for possible interview.•    Compensation: 30k+ part time, 75-100k full time, 100k+ Management</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>We provide No Credit Check Financing to customers of Small and Medium size Businesses and can help 90% of the industries from Auto Mechanics to Dentists and Lawyers.We are seeking skilled Account Managers to grow with us and help us achieve our goals in this new and exciting industry.This is designed as a long-term position for an entrepreneurial individual to really build their book of business, along with their income.Our people enjoy a flexible work environment.

You are NOT paying to work; you are paying for your benefits. You would not want to receive a haircut from someone who has never cut hair before, would you? You need to have the benefits in order to properly sell the benefits package and understand how good the benefits are.

You have nothing to lose! (Note: Your initial plan payment may be paid by either debit card or credit card (IE- Visa, Master Card, American Express or Discover). Plan payments may also be made with an active checking account; however, there is a delay in the clearing of funds, which will also delay your coverage and the ability to start signing up members.
